Explanation of group permissions:
Each number we should represent as a binary number and for each
user we will get permission bits in the following order:  user -> group -> other. 
Each group of bits specifies the access bits in the following order: read / write / execute.

1) In case: 660
6 in binary representation: 110
0 in binary representation: 000

user: can read and write, but cannot execute
group: can read and write, but cannot execute
other: cannot read, write and execute

2) In case: 775
7 in binary representation: 111
5 in binary representation: 101

user: can read, write and execute
group: can read, write and execute
other: can execute and read, cannot write

3) In case: 777
7 in binary representation: 111

user: can read, write and execute
group: can read, write and execute
other: can read, write and execute
