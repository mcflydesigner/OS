Physical address:
it is an address(binary number) to a physical cell(usually, small) with a limited size of the memory(usually, RAM). 
The main thing is that the cell is physically exist on some chips. 
In addition, in most cases the physical address cannot be accessed directly since the request to memory
must go through Memory Management Unit(MMU). We use physical addresses to access physical cells.

Virtual address:
it is a generated address(binary number) to a cell which is located in the virtual memory. The main thing is that
the cell can be stored in different types of memory by switching parts of the memory(pages) between fast and expensive and low and cheap mem.
Virtual address are mapping to physical addresses using MMU module which is responsible for mapping addresses and switching pages.
We use them to simulate that our machine has more fast and expensive memory because in most cases fast and expensive memory which is overloaded, but we need
to put new data there too somehow.
