High hit / miss ratio:
Sequence: 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 3 2 4 3 2 3
N = 2
Number of hits = 11
Number of misses = 7
Number of hits / Number of misses = 1.571429

Low hit / miss ratio:
1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5
N = 3
Number of hits = 6
Number of misses = 14
Number of hits / Number of misses = 0.428571

Explanation:
The aging principle is based on the following: pages that were used in the last few instructions will be used again soon.
If we look at high hit / miss ratio we will see that if we often request the same pages with a small interval we will git them with a high probability,
because the algorithm stores least recently used elements in the page.
If we look at low hit / miss ration we will observe that if we request different pages or same page but with long interval, the probability to get
the page from the table will be low since the algorithm holds only least elements which were referenced recently.
